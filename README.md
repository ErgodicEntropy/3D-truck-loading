Operations research is a scientific discipline that uses several techniques from fields such as mathematical modeling, simulation, optimization theory, computer science and other fields to solve complex decision making problems concerning processes and operations. In that telling, operations research is linked to decision theory and industrial engineering. Operations research is also known as management science.

The ROADEF/Euro challenge 2022 is a supply chain decision problem. Supply chain decision problems are one of the most famous problems in operations research. They require analytical methods and techniques from a plethora of fields (Queuing theory, Graph theory, Combinatorial Optimization, Discrete modeling...etc).
In this project, few algorithms dedicated to solve the very simple iterations of 3D truck loading problem are presented (Genetic algorithms, Greedy algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Independent Set search...etc), correct the model every step and resolve more complicated versions until the whole problem is covered. Bin packing problems are solved iteratively using different methods, then VM packing problems are considered solved using the same methods but scaled to VM structures. At least, the temporal dimenson is added via efficient surjective matching.
