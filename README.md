# 3D-truck-loading
Few algorithms dedicated to solve the very simple iterations of 3D truck loading problem, correct the model every step and resolve more complicated versions until the whole problem is covered. Bin packing problems are solved iteratively using different methods, then VM packing problems are considered solved using the same methods but scaled to VM structures.
